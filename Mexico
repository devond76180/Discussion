Another discussion on what is wrong.  Much better to learn from others mistakes.

Why is Mexico not the US? 

Minerals, geography, size, close to US opertunites, what is wrong.  We can talk about corruption,
drugs, one party control until recently, many other issues.  I have been told that if the illegals
were not allowed into the US that Mexico would devolve into a revolution, probably not.

For some reason the people have a "put one over on the other guys mindset".  It is a country of conmen.
Once I head that everything I see makes sense. You cannot advance if when you rise up, everyone looks 
to take you down.

There is no community in this.  You have to trust others.  Know that they can help and will help you when
needed.
