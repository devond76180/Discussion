Most of you will think this crazy, but I think we need setup communism.  First "C"ommunism is crap.  
Somehow Communism is about economics, when it should be about people.  communism should be about bringing 
people together in a community.  That is the first and most important lie from Communists.  We are not in 
communties to help the community, the communites are to help people.  Communists us the idea of community,
people comming together for a greater good, to sell their stupid economic ideas and their horrific community
above the person ideas, to kill millions and destroy innovation, creativity and most of all the good emotions
and capablities of humanity.  

Communism as an economomic system has failed in every form and version, down to the small community of pilgrams
in the New World, who neary starved until they tossed the every works for the common.  The from every how can to 
everyone who needs meets the reality of human nature.  When there is no way to advance on merit, there is not reason
to try harder.  "I pretend to work and they pretend to pay me".

So why am I talking about communism.  People are sold on "C"ommunisn because of the community part of it.  
WE NEED TOBE A COMMUNITY.  We need to be physically with others taking, working with each other.  Disagreeing with 
someone cannot be solved by simple blocking them with a button.  It must be talked out and worked out.  Otherwise 
we are not advancing, adding nothing to the community, simply existing, "Living just for today".
